# Face Mask Recognition
This repository contains a deep learning model for detecting whether individuals are wearing face masks or not in images or real-time video streams.

## Overview
The face mask detection model utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning to achieve accurate and efficient detection of face masks. It is built on top of the TensorFlow and Keras frameworks.

## Usage
Training:

If you want to train the model on your custom dataset:

Prepare your dataset containing images of people with and without face masks.

Organize your dataset into two folders: one for images with face masks and another for images without face masks.

Update the paths and parameters in the training script if necessary.
